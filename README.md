# FNF - 3D Engine. Forked from psych engine.

I created an engine to handle the notes as 3D plane objects.
This allows for true 3D modcharts.

Unlike a lot of other mods where it either relies on shaders, faking 3D, or just flat-out uses a different game engine
This uses away3D to use REAL 3D in fnf. So you can use 3D in flixel.

You can change the quality in settings and it's a bit primitave.
Also lua is a bit f**ky but other than that this is playing well.

THIS IS WIP!
